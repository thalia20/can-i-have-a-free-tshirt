## The Haiku
DigitalOcean  
Please give me a free T-shirt  
Thank you very much 

## The Badum Tish
I asked DigitalOcean for a free T-Shirt, but it was a total acid-wash.

## The Paradox
Is a free t-shirt really free if I have to contribute to open source software and make pull requests?

## The Pledge
We, the people creating PRs from this repository, pledge that we will one day make real contributions to Open Source in order to earn the t-shirt. We assure Digital Ocean and GitHub that giving us the t-shirt is therefore truly Utilitarian.

## Back for 2016
Another year, another t-shirt! I've written quite a few open source applications this year.

## Just a final PR
The last PR until next time!

## Free 
Free

## 2018 is here
Time flies doesn't it?

## A new Year a new PR

## I want one too ** 2018 **
